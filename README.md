# 🛑 nvm-marry (Never Marry)

> A programmer’s resistance library.  
> Not just code — a mindset. A wake-up call. A personal revolution.

## 💭 What is this?

`nvm-marry` is a philosophical-satirical open source library written to challenge the traditional idea of marriage, especially through the eyes of those who build, think, and create — not conform.

This is not about hate. It’s about clarity.  
It’s about asking the question:

> "Why invest in a system that starts with -1000?"

## ❌ Why NOT marry?

Because we’re done with:

- 💸 Losing money for emotional blackmail.
- ⛓️ Being trapped in contracts that steal freedom.
- 🧃 Draining our energy to "build a life" for someone who might leave with half of it.
- 🧠 Acting like bots in a broken social simulation.

```js
let marry = -1000;
console.log("I'm get:", marry); // I'm get: -1000
